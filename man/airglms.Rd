\title{Select generalized linear models automatically}
\usage{
airglms(config_file, verbose = FALSE, sort = "default")
}
\arguments{
\item{config_file}{Name of the configuration file with analysis settings.}

\item{verbose}{Print intermediate results of GLM selection while running (default: FALSE)}
}
\description{
The main function of the package.
It is used to automatically select generalized linear models (GLM).
The dependent and independent variables and interactions to be tested,
distributions and link functions, base model, data frame and
output file name are determined by the user in a configuration file.
GLM selection is performed with forward stepwise selection
using Akaike information criteria.
Returns an object with a character vector (selected model) and data frame
(stepwise AIC values) for each dependent variable, and writes detailed
output to the file specified.
